### Author: Anna Lozenko

Repository for storing and sharing weekly task results from the Programming and Scripting course.

## **Weekly Tasks**:

**Weekly Task 1:** helloworld.py  

This file should contain a python program that displays Hello World! when it is run.



**Weekly Task 2:** bank.py  

The program should:  
Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent)  
Add the two amounts  
Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount   



**Weekly Task 3:** accounts.py

Program that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).



**Weekly Task 4:** collatz.py

Program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.  
At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.  
Have the program end if the current value is one.



**Weekly Task 5:** weekday.py

Program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday.



**Weekly Task 6:** square_root.py

Program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.  
Create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).  
Check the newton method at estimating square roots. 



**Weekly Task 7:** count_characters.py

Program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains. Think about what is being asked here, document any assumptions you are making.  
The program should take the filename from an argument on the command line.



**Weekly Task 8:** plottask.py

Write a program called plottask.py that displays:  
a histogram of a normal distribution of a 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2, and a plot of the function  h(x)=x3 in the range 0 to 10, on the one set of axes.  
Please put a copy of the image of the plot (.png file) into the repository.
